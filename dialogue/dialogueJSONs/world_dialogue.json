		"Standy: Who are you?",
		"Guru K: I am a new age Guru, Sarasara. I sense your determination, but also your struggle. Scaling this mountain requires not just physical strength but also mental clairty and focus",
		"Standy: Mental clarity?",
		"Guru K: Yes beta, there is a practice called Pratyahara, the art of withdrawing the senses. You are a rectangle with no mouth, nose and no hands. You only need to withdraw two senses, sight and smell. Withdrawing your senses helps in turning your mind inwards and slowing down the chaos around you",
		"Standy: How do I do that?",
		"Guru K: One simple technique is fixed point gazing. Focus your gaze on a single point, 
		like the tip of this mountain. As you concentrate, let go of all distractions and external sensations. 
		You will enter a flow state, which will help you navigate distractions and achieve your goal.",
		"Guru K: Press Q to try it now, and then R to hit the 'sweet spot'",
		"Standy: That sounds helpful. I'll try it. Thank you Guru Sarasara",
		"Guru K: Go, Go Beta. Use it when the path is difficult or unclear.",
